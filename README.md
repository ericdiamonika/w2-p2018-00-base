# Mobile First base repository
This is a basic repository to start the HETIC Mobile First course.

## Installation
Make sure that [NodeJS and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) are installed on your computer. You will also need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

To begin, fork this repository ("Fork" button just up there).
Change the forked repository name (in "Settings" panel) to match your team number. For exemple : w2-p2018-07-name-of-the-project

Finally, clone your repository (uppercase elements are to be replaced depending on your context) :
```sh
$ cd MY/WEBSITES/FOLDER/
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/w2-p2018-07-name-of-the-project.git
$ cd w2-p2018-07-name-of-the-project
```

## Usage
Simply run the following commands into the project directory:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm install gulp -g # you might need "sudo" before that if you get an error
$ gulp
```
Your site should now be running at http://localhost:3000
